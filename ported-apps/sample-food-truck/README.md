# Food Truck Sample App - Tsyne Port

A food truck order management system ported from Apple's SwiftUI sample app to **Tsyne**, a TypeScript-based desktop application framework.

This is an idiomatic single-file Tsyne application that demonstrates:
- **Order Management**: Track pending, ready, and completed orders
- **Sales Analytics**: Visualize top-selling menu items with bar charts
- **Weather Integration**: Display and update location weather
- **Responsive Sidebar Navigation**: Switch between views with `when()` declarative visibility
- **Pseudo-Declarative UI**: Clean, readable builder pattern matching Tsyne best practices

## Features

### Orders View
- Add quick orders (Burger, Tacos, Pizza, or Random item)
- Track orders through three states: Pending → Ready → Completed
- View order details (ID, items, total)
- Single-button state transitions

### Sales Analytics
- Display top 5 selling menu items
- ASCII bar chart visualization
- Total sales calculation (pending + ready orders only)
- Real-time updates as orders change

### Weather
- Display current location weather (city, temperature, condition)
- Weather emoji icons
- Random weather updates for testing

## Architecture

The app follows Tsyne's MVC pattern with three main components:

### Model: `FoodTruckStore`
- Observable pattern with change listeners
- Immutable data returning defensive copies
- Methods for order and weather management

### View: Declarative UI with `when()`
- Conditional visibility of order/sales/weather views
- Uses `bindTo()` for smart list rendering
- Sidebar for persistent navigation

### Controller: Event Handlers
- Order state transitions: `markOrderReady()`, `markOrderCompleted()`
- Menu actions: `addOrder()`
- Weather updates: `updateWeather()`

## Running the App

### Development (with Xvfb on cloud)
```bash
# Setup environment (if needed)
apt-get update -qq
apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev libxrandr-dev

# Install dependencies
npm install --ignore-scripts

# Build bridge
npm run build:bridge

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Run the app
npx tsx ported-apps/sample-food-truck/index.ts
```

### Desktop Integration
When running Tsyne's desktop environment, the Food Truck app is automatically discovered and available:
```bash
npx tsx examples/desktop-demo.ts
```

## Testing

### Jest Unit Tests
```bash
npm test ported-apps/sample-food-truck/index.test.ts
```

Tests cover:
- Store functionality (orders, menu, weather)
- Observable subscriptions
- Data integrity and immutability
- Analytics calculations

### TsyneTest Integration Tests
```bash
npm test ported-apps/sample-food-truck/index.tsyne.test.ts
```

Tests cover:
- UI rendering and navigation
- Order lifecycle and status transitions
- View switching with `when()` visibility
- Weather updates
- Screenshot capture for documentation

### Screenshots
To generate screenshots during tests:
```bash
TAKE_SCREENSHOTS=1 npm test ported-apps/sample-food-truck/index.tsyne.test.ts
```

Screenshots will be saved to:
- `/tmp/food-truck-orders.png` - Orders view
- `/tmp/food-truck-sales.png` - Sales analytics view
- `/tmp/food-truck-weather.png` - Weather view

## Code Style

This port demonstrates Tsyne best practices:

```typescript
// Pseudo-declarative UI construction with builder pattern
a.window({ title: 'Food Truck Manager' }, (win) => {
  win.setContent(() => {
    a.hbox(() => {
      // Sidebar with navigation
      a.vbox(() => {
        a.button('Orders').onClick(async () => {
          selectedView = 'orders';
          await showView('orders');
        });
      }, 220, true); // Width 220, vertical stretch

      // Main content area with when() visibility
      viewStack = a.vbox(() => {
        // Orders view with bindTo for smart list rendering
        ordersContainer = a.vbox(() => { /* ... */ })
          .bindTo({
            items: () => store.getPendingOrders(),
            render: (order) => { /* render each order */ },
            trackBy: (order) => order.id,
          })
          .when(() => selectedView === 'orders');

        // Sales and Weather views similarly...
      });
    });
  });

  // Observable subscriptions trigger reactive updates
  store.subscribe(async () => {
    await updateStatusSummary();
    await viewStack.refresh();
  });
});
```

## Single Script Design

The entire application is contained in a single `index.ts` file (~450 lines), demonstrating Tsyne's ability to build complex, feature-rich applications without the overhead of webpack, build chains, or component frameworks. This is a direct contrast to the original Apple SwiftUI sample, which requires Xcode, Swift Package Manager, and multi-file project structure.
