## Original Work

This Tsyne port is derived from **GrandPerspective** by Erwin Bonsma:

## Port

The Tsyne port adapts the core treemap visualization and interaction model
to work with TypeScript and the Fyne GUI toolkit via Tsyne's bridge.

Core algorithms (squarified treemap layout) and UI paradigms (disk usage
visualization, drill-down navigation, color schemes) are derived from
the original macOS application.
