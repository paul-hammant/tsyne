# Code of Conduct

## Be Nice

No harassment or hate speech of any kind will be tolerated.

## Stay On Topic

This is about TypeScript app development of Fyne.io applications. Try to find a way back from side conversations.

## Be Mature

- Use "I could be wrong, but..." when debating
- Criticize things, not people: "Could we have tests, please?" vs "You should have written tests"
- Assume good intentions
- Value learning over being right

## Enforcement

- Violations get a private warning first
- Repeated or severe violations result in exclusion
- Decisions can be appealed by contacting maintainers
