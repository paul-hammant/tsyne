# Tsyne TODO

This document tracks future improvements, technical debt, and feature requests for the Tsyne project.

## Infrastructure & Architecture

### Migrate to Unix Domain Sockets

**Priority**: Low (v0.2.0+)
**Status**: Not started

Migrate IPC from stdin/stdout to Unix Domain Sockets (Linux/macOS) with fallback to TCP localhost (Windows). This would allow unrestricted logging and debugging.
