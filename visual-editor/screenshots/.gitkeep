This directory stores screenshots of the Visual Editor for documentation.

To regenerate screenshots:
1. Ensure Puppeteer is installed: npm install --save-dev puppeteer
2. Start the server: node visual-editor/server.js
3. Run: TAKE_SCREENSHOTS=1 node visual-editor/capture-screenshots.js

Note: Puppeteer requires a browser environment. Screenshots should be captured
in a local development environment, not in CI/CD.
